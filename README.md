📝 Item Lister

A simple JavaScript app to add, delete, and search through items in a list. This project was a part of my full-stack learning journey, specifically to strengthen my JavaScript skills.

🌟 Features
Add Items: Easily add items to the list with a single click.
Delete Items: Remove items from the list by clicking the delete button.
Search Bar: Filter through items as you type, making it simple to find what you’re looking for.

Challenges & Learning
As I’m new to JavaScript, understanding how to create and manipulate elements dynamically was a rewarding challenge. Special thanks to [Traversy Media] for the helpful guidance along the way.
